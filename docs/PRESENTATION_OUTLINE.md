- **Energy:** Enthusiasm shows commitment!

### Q&A Preparation:
**Likely Questions:**
1. **"How will the AI model be trained?"**
   - Answer: Historical student data (grades, attendance), supervised learning with labeled outcomes (pass/fail), validated against teacher assessments

2. **"What if the school doesn't have enough data?"**
   - Answer: We'll use transfer learning from similar schools, start with smaller datasets, continuously improve as more data is collected

3. **"How accurate will the predictions be?"**
   - Answer: Target 75-85% accuracy, will validate with teachers, predictions are advisory not absolute

4. **"Data privacy concerns?"**
   - Answer: All data anonymized, encrypted storage, compliance with RA 10173, consent forms from all parties

5. **"Why web instead of mobile app?"**
   - Answer: Cross-platform compatibility, no installation needed, easier deployment in schools, responsive design works on mobile anyway

6. **"Timeline realistic?"**
   - Answer: Yes, UI already complete, have development experience, working with agile methodology, regular check-ins
